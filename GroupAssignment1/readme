Group Assignment 1 review

Yusuf Shakpaz
- "Took me about 5 hours, I did not run into any coding issues besides setting up our project to 
be able to run properly."

Nathan Levin
- Took 4-6 hrs
- Configuring the repository and folder structure for group work had the most issues. Allowing 
multiple users and understanding which directories should be set to "source" and what to define 
as packages took more reworking than the program code.
- Personal solution ran slower than group solution due to the order of processing and displaying
results.

Natan Artemiev
- "I would say I took around 4 hours collectively on my solution, and about an 1hr on the group work."
